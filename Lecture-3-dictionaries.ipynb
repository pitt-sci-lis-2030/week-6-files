    "Like a list becuase there are values and each has an index.\n",
    "Not like a list because the indicies are not implicit, they can be more than numbers, and there is no order.\n",
    "In a dicitonary, data is stored in *key*/*value* pairs. The *key* is the index and and *value* is the actual data.\n",
    "When you create an *item* in a dictionary (another term for the key/value pairs) then you store teh data in the dictionary.\n",
    "To get the data back out we use the key to *lookup* the value in the dictionary. In this way the dictionary behaves like a english language dictionary. The key is like the word and the value is like the definition."
